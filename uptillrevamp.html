                <h2>Motivation for Revamp</h2>
                <p>
                    The old user interface was designed by me using a concept from a previous app. It was not clean and had a lot of unecessary information. I wanted to revamp the app to have a minimal and cleaner look and so I worked with Patricia Mutebi come up with the new design. The whole revamp is documented <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0xYYr0lD5A">here</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
                <p>
                    I continued to develop my mobile app development skills and broadened my knowledge of design. 
                    Download the app on the IOS app store <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;" target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uptill/id1558769552">here</a> and on the playstore <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.umacodes.countdown&hl=en&gl=US">here</a>.
