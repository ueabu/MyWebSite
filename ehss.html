                <h1>Economic Home Security System</h1>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    This was my senior design capstone project.
                </p>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    With approximately 2.5 million burglaries per year, home security solutions have become necessary in
                    order to protect your home from intruders.
                    While there has been rapid growth and development within the home security sector, many of the
                    solutions are often unaffordable or require large investments in redundant technology
                    from clients. In addition many existing products require you to use their proprietary cloud
                    technology, which is a security vulnerability itself.
                </p>
                <h3>High Level Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We will utilize multiple unused smartphone camera feeds to detect motion. Once motion is detected in
                    any of the clientâ€™s camera feeds,
                    we send the client a notification with a screenshot of the motion that was detected if deemed a
                    threat. Upon opening the notification,
                    the client is given an option to view and delete the clip. If the event is considered to be a home
                    intrusion, our server generates an incident report containing time of
                    occurrence and video footage of the entire time frame of the event.
                    These incidents are then stored and made available for consumption on our client facing web
                    application.
                </p>
                <h3>Lessons Learnt</h3>
                <p>
                    I learnt a lot about WebRTC, a video streaming protocol that a lot of todays video calls and
                    streaming are based off. I also used tensor flow library/framework for image
                    detection on the front end.
