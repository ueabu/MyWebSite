                <p>
                    UpTill is an app that helps you keep track and countdown to events you have coming up. It shows you the number of days
                    left till your event. You can also customize the countdown by adding background pictures to the countdown. When you tap a countdown,
                    it shows you a live countdown, to the second, of the date and time of your event. See screenshots below.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    It had been a while since I worked on a mobile app and I wanted to work on one that was not to complicated.  
                </p>
                <h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the process of deploying apps on the IOS app store and on the google play store! I also learnt a lot about cloud schedulers, dates and times. 
                    Download the app on the IOS app store <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;" target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uptill/id1558769552">here</a> and on the playstore <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.umacodes.countdown&hl=en&gl=US">here</a>.
