                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    A graphic design portfolio made for <a href="http://www.wisdomabu.com" target="_blank"
                        style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Wizmeida</a>.
                    Inspired by <a href="https://www.alexcoven.com/" target="_blank"
                        style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Alex Coven</a> portfolio design, I worked with
                    <a href="http://www.wisdomabu.com" target="_blank"
                        style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Wizmeida</a> to create his web portfolio. It
                    has a collection
                    of all his work ranging from logos he had created to brands he created as well. Feel free to reach
                    out to him for graphic design
                    work. Wizmedia is a graphic designer based in London, England. He also happens to be my amazing
                    older brother.

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    Wizmedia was looking to create his web portfolio and wanted it to be a custom design. I felt it
                    would be a great way to go
                    back to the basics of writing plane html, css and javascript/jqurey creating webpages from
                    wireframes.
                </p>
                <h3>Lessons Learnt</h3>
                <p>
                    Refereshed my knowledge on basic web languages and how to actually created a website without using a
                    framework. Learnt how to make the
                    web pages accessible and viewer friendly to different devices. Also refreshed my knowledge on
                    hosting a website on a server and working with custom domains.
